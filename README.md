A Night with a Necromancer - Text-Based Adventure Game
Overview
This project is a text-based video game created by Joseph Huffer as a submission for Project 2. The game involves exploring a castle, collecting mythical items, and ultimately facing off against a Necromancer. Players need to navigate through different rooms, collect items, and strategically plan their movements to succeed.

Instructions
To play the game, follow these instructions:

Run the code, and the game will start in the "Spawn" room.
Use the "go North," "go South," "go East," or "go West" commands to navigate through the castle.
To add an item to your inventory, use the "get 'item name'" command (capitalization matters).
You can end the game at any time by typing 'End Game.'

Game Map
The castle is represented as a dictionary called "rooms," where each room has connections to other rooms and may contain a mythical item. The rooms include:

Spawn
Castle Gate
Castle Courtyard
Eastern Guardhouse
Western Guardhouse
Main Hall
Hidden Corridor
Cloister
Library
Castle Halls
Dungeon

Winning and Losing
To win, collect all 6 mythical items and reach the "Dungeon" room.
If you enter the "Dungeon" without enough items, the Necromancer will spot you, and you'll lose the game.
Gameplay

The game provides a continuous loop where players enter commands.
Movement commands now require the full direction, such as "go North" instead of just "N."
Player stats, including the current room and inventory, are displayed after each move.
Acquiring items is essential for success, and the game ends when the player wins or loses.

Quit or Exit
To exit the game, type "End Game," "Quit," or "Exit" during the gameplay.

Enjoy the adventure in "A Night with a Necromancer"!
